== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How can I show different custom fields for different Products? =
Using the Field display rules, the field can be set to display for a particular product or products as well as based on a category or categories. By setting a display rule based on Product/Category, you can have a different field for different Product/Categories. You can logically combine more than one rule with OR and AND functions.

= Can I set a Field label as a clickable link other than just a Text Label? =
Yes, you can. Enter the href tag in the given format as Label to display the field Label as a Clickable Link: 
<a href="https://themehigh.com">Visit Themehigh!</a>
With <img> tag Images can also be included in Label. 

= How to set the field unselected by default for a Select field and throw an alert to select one before moving to cart? =
Simply add a PIPE symbol ( | ) before the first option. The Select field will be left unselected for the customer to choose from at the Product page. 
Marking the select field as required, will throw the alert when a user tries to add the product to cart without making the selection.

= Is there a difference between the Telephone field and number field? How are these fields different from the regular Text field? =
The telephone field and number field are different from the Text field. 
The Input type of these field types makes them different. The Input of the number field is such that an Increment-Decrement provision is provided for entering the input. 
In the case of the Telephone type on responsive screen, a very suitable Keypad for entering Telephone number is displayed.

= What is a Hidden field and how does it work? =
The hidden field is a field which is never displayed on the Product page. The store owner can set a value for the field which cannot be edited by the customer.
